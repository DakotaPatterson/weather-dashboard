A weather dashboard with the 5 day forecast

## Description

This project is a weather dashboard to display the current weather and the future forecast. My motivation was to make a webpage that allowed a user to enter a city name and recieve the current weather along with the predicted weather for the next 5 days. This webpage allows the user to enter a city to search for the weather, this city is then saved in the search history for easy use when needed again. I have learned that making sure the Javascript is interactive to the user and displays with visually appealing css makes a webpage unique and fun to traverse.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The best way to use this is to enter a city name and then click the [Search Button](assets/searchButton.png).

Once this is complete the current weather and the 5 day forecast will be displayed on the screen.

If you would like to search the same city again you would just need to click the [City Name](assets/cityName.png) and the information would be displayed again.
